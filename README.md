# SAS Viya with Azure OpenAI Integrations

## Data Querying in SAS Viya Using Natural Language

Please navigate to: [data_query_using_natural_language](/data_query_using_natural_language/README.md).

Data querying and data analysis using natural language on any dataset is now possible with Azure OpenAI's Assistant API, specifically through its Function Calling feature. This allows users to analyze data in SAS Viya without writing complex SAS code.

By leveraging a simple Python program, users can interact with the assistant to ask questions in natural language. The assistant translates these questions into SAS code, executes it in the SAS Viya environment, and returns the results in a user-friendly format.

SASPy, a Python package, facilitates the connection between Python and SAS Viya, enabling seamless data querying and analysis.

This approach supports various data sources, including SAS libraries, databases, and cloud data sources, offering flexibility and efficiency. It empowers users to perform complex data analyses without technical skills, focusing on insights rather than programming.
